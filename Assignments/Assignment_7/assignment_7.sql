-- question 4a
-- make sure that privileges are as limited as possible for secruity starting with column privileges first and working up the ladder if needed
 -- Global: Possbily set all users to have READ ACCESS ONLY
 -- Database: Ensure ONLY the needed databases are accessed

-- question 4b
-- set roles will make it easier to define each person 
-- give a few example roles you would create (e.g. DEV, SALESMAN, CUSTOMER)
-- Auto assign roles at user creation
